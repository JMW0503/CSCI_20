Bool- True and False; a binary variable having only two possible values, true or false 

Expression- a combination of values, variables, operators, that are interpreted according 
to the rules of precedence by a programming language, which computes and produces another value.

Examples:

4 + 8: expression that produces 12
8 - 9: produces -1

Boolean Expression:

2 < 3: expression that produces True
1 == 2: expression that produces False

4 > 3 AND 1 > 0: expression that produces True

1 < 7 AND 9 > 10: expression that produces False

1 < 3 OR 5 > 6: expression that produces true
